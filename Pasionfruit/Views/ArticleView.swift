In this presentation I will be focusing on Application Development. However, some things I mention during this article could also apply to Operating Systems. Apps are becoming more important especially in this time where devices and their apps are used in our lives more than ever.")

You may ask, what are Programming Languages? Programming Languages is how we translate what we want the device to do into something it can understand. Popular Languages for development include C, Python, Java, and the one I am using is, Swift.  Which one you use largely depends on the platforms you would like to support.")

The middle of the bunch is C and its derivites. But the hardest of the bunch I would consider to be Java.")

Anyways, every year since I was ten years old, I wanted to learn how to program. But after 4 weeks, I would usually give up. I am thankful for the passion project assignment. It helped me be determined and focused on learning app development and as a result programming. In the small time we were given I had learned 14 days worth of lessons in 7 days and then spent the remainder of the time developing this app.")
