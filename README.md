# Passionfruit
2019-2020 School Passion Project Mac App

During COVID Lockdown, we were assigned a passion project which let us learn whatever we liked. I chose Programming/App Development.

Passionfruit is a combination of a Calculator, Riddle Giver, To-Do List, and Fact GIver. 

It's design was based on macOS Catalina's Music App, which in turn gave it the modern design of Big Sur and later.
